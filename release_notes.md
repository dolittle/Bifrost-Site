# Version 1.0.0.19 & 1.0.0.20
Due to some strange behavior of the NuGet servers yielding error messages claiming errors in the Package metadata and also that versions where missing. We ended up releasing a couple of versions thinking our packages were corrupt. Therefor, these versions are exactly the same as 1.0.0.18.

# Version 1.0.0.18
* Added process callbacks for ICommandFor<> (#614)
* Configuring messenger for desktop when configuring for desktop (Configure.Frontend.Desktop()) - as a singleton (#617)

## Process Callbacks (#614)

	public class ViewModel
	{
		public ViewModel(ICommandFor<MyCommand> commandFor)
		{
			commandFor.Succeeded((cmd, result) => {
				// Things to do when successful
			});

			commandFor.Failed((cmd, result) => {
				// Things to do when failed
			});

			commandFor.Handled((cmd, result) => {
				// Things to do when handled
			});
		}
	}

# Version 1.0.0.17
* FromMethod extension in WPF/XAML client can now take an IValueConverter to use for converting parameters (#616)

## ParameterConverter (#616)

	<Button Command="{interaction:FromMethod NameOfMethod, CanExecuteWhen=NameOfMethodOrProperty, ParameterConverter={StaticResource AValueConverter}}"/>


# Version 1.0.0.16
* FromMethod extension in WPF/XAML client now supports CanExecute (#612)
* ICommandFor<> can now be generated from a concrete instance of a command (#611)
* Fix for assembly filtering to filter assemblies delay loaded after initial initialization (#613)

## CanExecute for FromMethod
In the Interaction namespace of Bifrost when using the client, you'll find a markup extension called FromMethod. This extension now supports the capability of taking 

	<Button Command="{interaction:FromMethod NameOfMethod, CanExecuteWhen=NameOfMethodOrProperty}"/>

The *CanExecuteWhen* property of the extension is optional and can take either a method or a property. If it is a method, the method can be a method without any parameters or with one parameter and the command parameter will then be passed in. The return type needs to be of type *bool*, same goes for if it is a property. If the declaring type implements *INotifyPropertyChanged* and you're specifying a property - it will trigger a *CanExecuteChanged* event for the returning command when the property changed so it can be evaluated by the WPF infrastructure again. 


# Version 1.0.0.15
* Configure startup now uses same AssemblyProvider as the rest of the system

# Version 1.0.0.14
* ICommandFor<> support for client in place with full proxy generation of the frontend concerns. Fully bindable in XAML.

# Version 1.0.0.13
* AssemblyFiltering for startup in place. For now accessible from the DiscoverAndConfigure() method on the configure object

## Usage
For instance, lets say you have a WPF application, the way you would use this is would be in your App.xaml.cs file:

	using Bifrost.Configuration;
	using Bifrost.Configuration.Assemblies;

	namespace YourApp
	{
		public partial class App : Application
		{
			static App()
			{
				Configure.DiscoverAndConfigure(a=>
					a.IncludeAll()
						.ExceptAssembliesStartingWith("System","Microsoft"));
			}
		}
	}

	
In the future there will be other mechanisms as well which would apply better for Web scenarios where one does not call DiscoverAndConfigure manually. Also, the sample above with "System" and "Microsoft" will eventually be something Bifrost itself will filter, this is linked to the future mechanism coming.


# Version 1.0.0.12
* XAML Visual Tree extensions
* Adding better check for wether or not an assembly is a .NET assembly during location instead of relying on BadImageException

## More convenient way to import instances of types - #534

In Bifrost we have something called ITypeImporter and ITypeDiscoverer. The importer imports the types as instances, that means the implementation uses the IOC container to resolve an instance when calling the .Import*<>() methods. The discoverer is responsible for just discovering the types when calling the Find*<>() methods and has nothing to do with instances. With this release, we're introducing something that makes this whole thing more explicit, clearer and easier to use. There is now an interface called IInstancesOf<> that you can take a dependency on. The interface inherits IEnumerable<> and as a consequence the implementation InstancesOf<> will do the instantiation when its enumerated. The way you can use this is:

	using Bifrost.Execution;

	namespace MyNamespace
	{
		public class MySystem
		{
			public MySystem(IInstancesOf<SomeAbsractOrInterfaceType> instances)
			{
				// The enumerator will now instantiate through the IOC container
				// giving you an instance with correct lifecycle
				foreach( var instance in instances ) 
				{
				}
			}
		}
	}


## SignalR support

We are now generating Bifrost proxies for hubs - these are placed in the namespace corresponding to the namespace maps set up for the application. Once you have created a hub like so:

	using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;

	namespace Web.BoudedContext.Module
	{
		public class MyHub : Hub
		{
			public int DoSomething(int someInteger, string someString)
			{
				return 42;
			}
		}
	}


From your JavaScript - for instance a ViewModel, you can now do this:

	Bifrost.namespace("Web.BoundedContext.Module", {
		myFeature: Bifrost.views.ViewModel.extend(function(myHub) {

			myHub.server.doSomething(43,"fourty three")
					.continueWith(function(result) {
				// Result should be 42...
			});
		});
	});


The "myHub" dependency will automatically be injected by convention. All hubs are placed in the closest matching namespace. If none is found, there is a global namespace called hubs that will hold it. The last dependency resolver in the chain will be the one that recognizes the global namespace and it will always be found.

With this you don't have to think about starting the SignalR Hub connection like one would have to do with a bare SignalR. Bifrost manages this on the first hub being used.

You might notice that instead of what might be expected when working with SignalR for results coming back from calls to the server:

	.done(function() {}) 

We are using the Bifrost promise instead. This is because we want consistency with Bifrost, not with SignalRs proxies. In fact, we are not using the SignalR proxies at all, but our own proxy generation engine as we use for the generation of proxies for Commands, Queries, ReadModels, Security, Validation and more.

If you want to set up client funtions that you want for the particular Hub instances, you can do this by doing the following:

	myHub.client(function(client) {
		client.doSomething = function(someString, someNumber) {
			// Do things in the client called from the server
		};
	});

This will subscribe to any method calls from the server corresponding to the name of the function. The above code can be called anytime, there is no ordering to think of as with vanilla SignalR were you have to do this prior to starting the Hub connection.
